## Hello there. Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Sid. I develop Open-Source Privacy-Oriented Secure by default software, I'm also into DevOps and security. Check out my portfolio [here](https://sidsun.com) :)

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m learning software design architectures, cryptography with a hint of networking by the side.
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting OSS.
- ðŸ’¬  Brain Teaser: What is the thing about the thing that makes the thing the thing?
- âš¡  Fun fact: This README was inspired from [black-dragon74](https://github.com/black-dragon74/black-dragon74)
